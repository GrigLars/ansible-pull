# ansible-pull
I want to see if ansible pull is a viable thing for new builds. There's not a lot of documentation about how this works, so this is my public attempt to figure it out.  Some of the sites I will be using:

* Offical Red Hat [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-pull.html) on ansible-pull
* This guy's repo
